# Mongoose
Upon a user visiting my page the app should scrape stories from a news outlet 
The app will display the articles for the user.
Each scraped article is saved to the application database.
At a minimum, the app should scrape and display the following information for each article:

    * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

     * Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).

Users can leave comments on the articles displayed 
Users can revisit comments later 
Comments will be saved to the database
Comments will be associated with their articles.
Users can delete comments left on articles. 
All stored comments are visible to every user.
